AWS Monolithic Architecture for Internal Business Applications: 
 

Designed for Project Management, Inventory Tracking, and Internal CRM 

 

Introduction 

Internal business applications such as project management tools, 
inventory tracking systems, and internal CRMs are ideal candidates 
for a monolithic architecture. These applications typically serve a 
limited number of users and developers, making a unified codebase and 
infrastructure efficient and maintainable. 

Architecture Overview 

Architecture Style: Monolithic 

AWS Services Used: 

- Amazon EC2: Hosts the monolithic application 

- Elastic Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming traffic 

- Amazon RDS: Stores relational data 

- Amazon S3: Stores static assets and backups 

- Amazon CloudFront: Caches and delivers static content 

- Amazon VPC: Provides networking with public/private subnets 

- IAM: Manages access control 

- Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors logs and metrics 

- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): Secures endpoints with HTTPS 

Workflow Description 

1. User sends HTTPS request. 

2. CloudFront caches and forwards request to ALB. 

3. ALB routes request to EC2 instance. 

4. EC2 monolithic app processes request. 

5. App queries RDS for data and S3 for static assets. 

6. Response flows back through ALB and CloudFront to user. 

Data Flow 

- Application data stored in Amazon RDS. 

- Static assets stored in Amazon S3 and cached via CloudFront. 

- Logs and metrics captured by CloudWatch. 

- IAM enforces least-privilege access. 

- ACM provides HTTPS encryption. 

Use Case Examples 

- Project Management Tool 

- Inventory/Asset Tracking System 

- Internal CRM
